(96, 'my-hero-academia-deku.jpg', 'MY HERO ACADEMIA: SEASON 1 REVIEW', '<p>&nbsp;Having not read the My Hero Academia manga, I had the luxury of going into the anime unaware of the twists and turns that awaited the aspiring young hero Izuku &quot;Deku&quot; Midoriya. After taking a ride on the action-packed emotional rollercoaster that is Season 1 of studio Bones&#39; expertly animated adaptation, My Hero Academia has solidified its place as my favorite show of the year thus far, and has me eagerly awaiting Season 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story centers around the aforementioned Deku, a teenage boy who dreams of becoming a superhero but finds himself among the 20 percent of people without a special power (aka Quirk). After a chance encounter with his heroic idol All Might, Deku finds a way to rise above his circumstances and attends the prestigious U.A. High School in the hopes of making his dreams a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the clear underdog amongst his peers, I found Deku to be immediately both likable and relatable, especially in contrast to his childhood rival Katsuki Bakugou. Despite being an egocentric bully hell-bent on tearing others down in favor of building himself up, Bakugou grew on me as the series progressed. It&#39;s clear he has some pride and anger management issues, but his drive to be a hero and protect society from the villains that threaten the peace is an admirable quality that makes him far more than a one-dimensional hothead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the rest of My Hero Academia&#39;s cast of heroes in training are multilayered and each interesting in their own right. From the studious and tightly-wound class president Tenya Iida, who&#39;s equipped with engine-powered legs, to the sweet and innocent Ochako Uraraka, who can make things levitate by simply touching them, U.A. High School boasts a colorful cast of diverse and wonderfully realized characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same can be said for the world&#39;s &quot;No. 1 Hero&quot; All Might, who is far more than just a big muscle-bound dude sporting a pearly white smile. Yes, even the most powerful of heroes have their weaknesses and need the help of others from time to time, and All Might&rsquo;s crippling secret does an excellent job of demonstrating&nbsp;that fact. Plus, the bond he forms with Deku that spirals into a mentorship role for a hero whose best days are clearly behind him creates a heartwarming dynamic that had me smiling every time the two of them were together on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strength of such a well-developed cast makes for a story that pulls you in and doesn&rsquo;t let go. The hints at a budding romance between Uraraka and Deku is adorable, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it plays out. Additionally, Deku&rsquo;s struggle to prove himself and gain the respect of Bakugou, despite his peer&rsquo;s unrelenting hatred towards Deku, makes for some really great moments of tension-filled drama, fueled by a rivalry that extends back to when they were children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most impactful of all, however, is the bond between Deku and his mother. Watching their relationship evolve, as Deku&rsquo;s mother realizes she should have supported her Quirkless son more in his quest to become a hero, had my eyes welling up with tears. Not only does this relationship provide a window into Deku&rsquo;s family life and his insecurities, it drives home the importance of family and supporting one another, no matter how farfetched dreams may appear to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Hero Academia&#39;s excellent character design only elevates the memorable cast even further. From Deku&#39;s kind and innocent smile to the intimidating stare that emanates from Bakugou&#39;s angry eyes, each character has their own distinct look that reflects their personality.&nbsp;I also have to applaud the casting choices and overall voice work, as Yowamushi Pedal&#39;s Daiki Yamashita is a perfect fit for Deku in the Japanese version, and Justin Briner does an excellent job as the character in the English dub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering Bones&#39; pedigree, it should come as no surprise that the studio behind Wolf&#39;s Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist has once again knocked it out of the park. My Hero Academia is loaded with incredible action scenes that are an absolute joy to watch, thanks to the fluid animation and dynamic angles at which they&#39;re presented. From little touches like the glistening eyes of an emotionally wrecked young Deku to the explosive set pieces brought on by Bakugou, each and every episode was a visual treat. There&#39;s also plenty of expertly delivered comedic bits strewn throughout the season, many of which can be attributed to the laughably inappropriate antics of Deku&#39;s tiny purple-haired classmate Minoru Mineta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike its well-realized cast of heroes, My Hero Academia&#39;s villains left me wanting more. The&nbsp;League of Villains&#39; leader Tomura Shigaraki has the potential to be a fascinating character with a deep and twisted backstory, but unfortunately very little of that was fleshed out in this season. Based on a few teases that pop up during the finale, it&#39;s clear we&#39;re going to learn a whole lot more about the antagonists of this series in Season 2, but a bit more backstory earlier on would have made Season 1&#39;s concluding showdown all the more impactful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, given the limited time in which this first season had to flesh out its cast, I&#39;m glad the bulk of the thirteen episodes focused on making Deku a relatable character and fleshing out his backstory. The series is centered on Deku&#39;s journey to become a hero, so having a strong foundational understanding of his character this early on will only serve to strengthen the overall story as My Hero Academia enters its second season.</p>', 24, NULL, NULL, 2),

He can be a shooting guard/scorer. That&rsquo;s the good thing about him&mdash;he&rsquo;s multi-dimensional. He&rsquo;s not fast, but he&rsquo;s quick. Fast is one-direction.&nbsp;<em>Pang</em>&nbsp;100-meter dash. Quick is&nbsp;<em>mabilis ang</em>&nbsp;first step. Scottie knows when to stop, when to go. His timing is very good.

He can help Gilas eventually.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONTINUE READING BELOW &darr;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another plus for Scottie, LA believes, is that his teammate&#39;s a special baller. &quot;He&rsquo;s a team player. He works hard. He rebounds hard. He&rsquo;s very smart. He just has to improve his point guard skills. If he can do that, he&rsquo;ll be a superstar. With his ability to jump, to defend, his instinct for where the ball will fall,&nbsp;<em>wala akong</em><em>&nbsp;nakikitang ibang&nbsp;</em>PBA player&nbsp;<em>ngayon&nbsp;</em>like Scottie.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former University of Perpetual Help King Atlas recognizes how big a challenge playing for Gilas will be. &quot;There&#39;s a lot at stake when you play with the National Team and for your country,&quot; Scottie says when told of LA&#39;s ringing endorsement. &quot;That&rsquo;s aside from preparing for the game, knowing the plays, learning the system, learning the chemistry.&nbsp;<em>Kada&nbsp;</em>coach<em>, iba ang&nbsp;</em>system<em>.</em>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scottie, a triple-double threat during his years in the NCAA, also adds: &quot;You don&rsquo;t know what to expect.

We just have to find a way to do it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, LA says he still misses playing for the National Team, but he admits he&#39;s satisfied he had fulfilled his duty as a Filipino by representing the country. &quot;<em>Natutuwa na din ako kasi yung&nbsp;</em>new generation of players gets to experience what we did. I&rsquo;m still very close with Jayson and Jimmy (Alapag). The bond that we had before is still there. When I retire, I&rsquo;ll be able to reflect on my time with Gilas.
